# Progeny-Summary

##This project consists of 3 codes which tries to compute the second filial generation of a Mendelian Cross. 'Progeny Summariser' tries to compute the Second Filial Generation with all frequencies, 'Demo to the Dissymmetry' tries to demonstrate a dissymetry among the genotypic ratios of various 'n' hybrid crosses regarding the frequencies of the offsprings arranged in order. 'manual cross' tries to demonstrate the satisfaction of Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium under the prior calculations.##
